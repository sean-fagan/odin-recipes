    <p>Chicken Marsala is a classic Italian-American dish that showcases tender, pan-seared chicken breasts simmered in a rich and savory Marsala wine sauce. The chicken is typically seasoned and lightly floured before being cooked to a golden brown, creating a delicious crust. The sauce, made with sweet Marsala wine, mushrooms, garlic, and often a hint of cream, complements the chicken beautifully, imparting deep, earthy flavors.</p>
    <p>The dish is usually garnished with fresh parsley, adding a pop of color and a touch of brightness. Served over a bed of pasta or alongside creamy mashed potatoes, Chicken Marsala is a comforting and elegant meal that perfectly balances savory and slightly sweet notes, making it a favorite in many homes and restaurants alike.</p>
